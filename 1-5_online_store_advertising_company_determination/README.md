## online_store_advertising_company_determination

The parameters determining the success of the game in different regions of the world are revealed. Based on this, a report has been prepared for a computer game store for planning advertising campaigns. Data preprocessing and analysis were carried out. The current period for analysis is selected. Portraits of users of each region have been compiled. Hypotheses have been tested: the average user ratings of the Xbox One and PC platforms are the same;
the average user ratings of the Action and Sports genres are different. The Student's criterion for independent samples was used in the analysis.
