## telling_a_story_about_data

I have investigated the question of whether a cafe in which guests are served by robot waiters will be successful and popular for a long time. Based on the results of the analysis, a presentation has been prepared for investors with recommendations. In plotting, I used
the seaborn and plotli libraries.

## Data
- `id` — object ID;
- `object_name` — name of the catering facility;
- `chain` — chain restaurant;
- `object_type` — type of catering facility;
- `address` — address;
- `number` — the number of seats.

## Results
As for the type of catering, I see a cafe or a bar as the best option. With regard to the location, we have identified 22 districts of the city of Moscow where this institution can be located. With regard to the number of seats, as it was determined above, on average cafes and bars have a capacity for 40 people, I think this figure is optimal.

## Stage
Project is fully completed
