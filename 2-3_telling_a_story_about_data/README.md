## telling_a_story_about_data

I have investigated the question of whether a cafe in which guests are served by robot waiters will be successful and popular for a long time. Based on the results of the analysis, a presentation has been prepared for investors with recommendations. In plotting, I used
the seaborn and plotli libraries.

## Data
- `id` — object ID;
- `object_name` — name of the catering facility;
- `chain` — chain restaurant;
- `object_type` — type of catering facility;
- `address` — address;
- `number` — the number of seats.
