## user_behavior

In this project, I have studied the principles of event analytics. I built a sales funnel, researched the users' path to purchase. Analyzed the results of the A/B test for the introduction of new fonts. I compared 2 control groups with each other, made sure that the traffic was divided correctly, and then compared it with the test group, it was revealed that the new font would not significantly affect user behavior.

## Data
- `eventName` — event name;
- `DeviceIDHash` — unique user ID;
- `EventTimestamp` — event time;
- `ExpId` is the experiment number:
- `246` and `247` are control groups, and `248` are experimental.
