## online_store_advertising_company_determination

The parameters determining the success of the game in different regions of the world are revealed. Based on this, a report has been prepared for a computer game store for planning advertising campaigns. Data preprocessing and analysis were carried out. The current period for analysis is selected. Portraits of users of each region have been compiled. Hypotheses have been tested: the average user ratings for the Xbox One and PC platforms are the same;
the average user ratings of the Action and Sports genres are different. The Student's criterion for independent samples was used in the analysis.

## Data:

- `Name` — the name of the game;
- `Platform` — platform;
- `Year_of_Release` — year of release;
- `Genre` — the genre of the game;
- `NA_sales` — sales in North America (millions of copies sold);
- `EU_sales` — sales in Europe (millions of copies sold);
- `JP_sales` — sales in Japan (millions of copies sold);
- `Other_sales` — sales in other countries (millions of copies sold);
- `Critic_Score` — critics' score (maximum 100);
- `User_Score` — user rating (maximum 10);
- `Rating` — rating from the ESRB (Entertainment Software Rating Board) organization (Eng. Entertainment Software Rating Board). This association determines the rating of computer games and assigns them a suitable age category.

## Results
In the course of this work, the following steps were taken:
- work has been done on data preprocessing;
- total sales for all regions are calculated;
- a research analysis of the data was carried out, according to the results of which it was determined how many games were released in different years. According to the graph, we can say that the growth in games produced began in 1993; the peak occurred in 2008 and 2009, and then we see a big decline;
- the change in sales by payment forms has been determined;
- the platforms with the highest total sales are identified - 'PS2', 'X360', 'PS3', 'Wii', 'Nintendo_DS', 'PS';
- the most profitable genres have been identified: 'Shooter', 'Sports', 'Platform', 'Role-Playing', 'Racing', 'Fighting', 'Action';
- the actual life period of the platform has been determined, which is 10 years;
- the leading sales platforms for the current period have been identified;
- the dependencies between the reviews of players and critics on sales have been worked out and patterns have been identified;
- the dependencies between certain genres and sales have been worked out and patterns have been identified;
- the most popular genres and platforms for users of the three regions have been identified;
- two two-sided hypotheses are put forward and calculations are given to confirm or refute these hypotheses.

Both hypotheses put forward were two-sided, which means that we only consider whether the assumption is true or not, and in which direction if not, it does not matter to us in the context of this task. The significance level was chosen to be 5%. The significance level numerically determines where the boundary of the probability of getting too far from the center of the distribution passes.

I consider games on the PS4 and XOne platforms to be priority goals for advertising companies. It is difficult to specify the platform in terms of the task, because: game sales depend on which game is released on a particular platform. Most games are cross-platform, i.e. they are released on all platforms almost simultaneously, but there are exceptions that are released exclusively on only one platform. So it is necessary to consider the list of upcoming games for 2017 for the full picture. This would help to more accurately determine the direction for the advertising company. Also, it is necessary to take into account the mood of the users of a particular platform. For example, "XOne" at the time of launch lost in all respects to its direct competitor "PS4". Hence such low starting sales in comparison with the "PS4".
